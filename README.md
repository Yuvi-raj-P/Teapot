Hello yall, this is my 4ish project for the arcade. This is a model of a teapot inspired from me after watching the alice and the wonderland. You can experience the model here: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/teapot-234a07fa75024f29bf584ddeedb366c7
Below are couple of screenshots of the final project
